How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
 Ensuring that code is functional and secure comes down to properly testing of the 
 code. This includes having a proper plan in place for correct times on testing   
 functions and algorithms. This may be after each function or lead node of the tree 
 diagram is complete and working us till the root node is reached. Also using 
 different methods of testing at different stages like automated testing to function 
 that may be altered to ensure correctness.  

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Understanding user needs comes at the beginning stages of development during 
  the planning stages. Knowing how and when the user my interact with a piece of 
  software is important with understanding why software is being made. With this 
  knowledge open ended questions can be asked as to what will or will not make a 
  final product. Things like user needs can be assessed once the bigger picture 
  has been realized. 
  
How do I approach designing software?
  Designing software can be easily done by determining an
  issue and knowing an answer for that issue. That solution is then broken down
  into parts that can make the solution smaller and easily handled. This can be
  repeated until the issue is as small as possible. While working through each
  stage of the code until a solution is completed it is important to test the
  code or sub solution to ensure that everything works and works together.
